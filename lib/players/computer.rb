=begin (this is the way to do multi-line comments in ruby. =begin and =end CANNOT BE INDENTED)
    NOTE: I'm pretty damn sure these can all be refactored using ternary operator.
    Something like return !taken?(MIDDLE) ? MIDDLE : possible_any_win : free_corner : first_empty_spot
    Okay, actually, I'm pretty sure that doesn't work and that it would have to be more like:
    !taken?(MIDDLE) ? MIDDLE :
      possible_any_win ? possible_any_win :
      free_corner ? free_corner :
      first_empty_spot
    So maybe it's not all that great.
